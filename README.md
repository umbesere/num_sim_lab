Numerical simulation laboratory excercises.

Each folder contains 2 pyhton notebooks: the one with "excercises" in the name is the task presentation while the one of the type "LSN_#excercise" is the task solution given by me.

The content spans from random walk models, option prcicing, MCMC methods, genetic algorithms and simple neural network application. Enjoy!
